Summarizes text by selecting

TODO:
- Make the sending of data from content to sidebar an object
	- So it may include more than just the text, see below
	
- Open dialog above mouseclick - present options.
	- Add to current paragraph
	- Create new paragraph
	- Create new section/title
	- Cancel

- Finding a custom way to represent the sidebar
	- One that can be placed right.

- Be able to 'style' the summary as the user
	- Scale text

- Add extra functions to the summary
	- Move text 'blocks' around after placing them.
		- This requires some serious work on how to insert the items.
